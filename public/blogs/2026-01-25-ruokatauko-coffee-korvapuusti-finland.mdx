# Ruokatauko! Ordering Coffee and a Korvapuusti Like a Finn

Imagine stepping into a cozy café in Helsinki on a chilly winter day. The aroma of freshly baked cinnamon buns fills the air, and the sound of friendly chatter creates a warm atmosphere. This is *ruokatauko*, the Finnish coffee break, a sacred ritual observed throughout the day. More than just a quick caffeine fix, it's a moment to pause, connect, and savor the simple pleasures of life. Today, we'll explore how to order coffee and a *korvapuusti* (cinnamon bun) like a true Finn, embracing this cherished cultural tradition.

## The Essence of Ruokatauko: More Than Just a Break

*Ruokatauko* is deeply ingrained in Finnish culture, representing a necessary pause during the workday or a social gathering with friends and family. It's a time to recharge, socialize, and enjoy a sweet treat alongside a cup of coffee. Finns take their coffee seriously, consuming more per capita than almost any other nation in the world. The *ruokatauko* is an integral part of Finnish work culture with many companies scheduling regular breaks to promote well-being and productivity. It is a time for *kuulumisia*, meaning ‘hearings’ or ‘news’, where colleagues and friends can catch up.

## Korvapuusti: The Perfect Companion to Coffee

No *ruokatauko* is complete without a *korvapuusti*. These delectable cinnamon buns, whose name translates to "slapped ears", are a national treasure. The dough is enriched with butter and cardamom, rolled out, generously filled with cinnamon and sugar, and then baked to golden perfection. They are best enjoyed warm, with a slightly crispy exterior and a soft, fluffy interior. The combination of cinnamon, cardamom, and sugar creates a symphony of flavors that perfectly complements the bitterness of Finnish coffee.
