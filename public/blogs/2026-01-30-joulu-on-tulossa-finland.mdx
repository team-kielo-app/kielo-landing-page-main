## Celebrating Christmas Eve: The Heart of Joulu

Christmas Eve, or *Jouluaatto*, is the most important day of the Finnish Christmas celebration. Traditionally, the day begins with a rice porridge breakfast, often with a hidden almond. Whoever finds the almond is said to have good luck in the coming year.

In the afternoon, many families visit the sauna to cleanse both body and mind before the evening's festivities. The declaration of Christmas Peace takes place at noon in Turku, a tradition dating back to the 13th century. This declaration is broadcast on radio and television, marking the official start of the Christmas season.

The evening is spent with family, enjoying a traditional Christmas meal, opening presents, and perhaps even a visit from *Joulupukki* (Father Christmas). *Joulupukki* lives in Korvatunturi, Lapland, and is known for his long white beard, red suit, and reindeer-pulled sleigh.

## Christmas Day and Beyond

Christmas Day, *Joulupäivä*, is a more quiet and reflective day, often spent relaxing at home or visiting relatives. Boxing Day, or *Tapaninpäivä*, is traditionally a day for visiting friends and neighbors.
