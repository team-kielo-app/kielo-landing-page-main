# Juhannus Taikaa: Celebrating Midsummer in Finland!

Juhannus, or Midsummer, is one of the most magical and important holidays in Finland. It's a time when the sun barely dips below the horizon, bonfires light up the night, and Finns celebrate nature, light, and life. **Juhannus Taikaa: Celebrating Midsummer in Finland!** It's a unique experience you won't soon forget, filled with ancient traditions and modern festivities. Let’s explore the wonders of this Finnish summer solstice celebration!

## The Magic of the Kokko (Bonfire)

The heart of Juhannus is the *kokko*, or Midsummer bonfire. Traditionally, these huge bonfires were believed to ward off evil spirits and guarantee a good harvest. Nowadays, the *kokko* symbolizes the burning away of the old and welcoming the new. Building and lighting the *kokko* is a communal effort, often done on islands or by lakeshores, creating a breathtaking spectacle as the flames reflect on the water. Many communities even have bonfire competitions, adding to the festive atmosphere. The bigger, the better!

Beyond the bonfire, Juhannus is steeped in traditions and superstitions. Many believe that Midsummer night is a time of powerful magic. Single women traditionally pick seven different flowers and place them under their pillow on Juhannus night, hoping to dream of their future husband. Another popular tradition involves visiting a sauna, often followed by a refreshing swim in a lake or the sea – a true Finnish experience! Dancing, singing, and enjoying the long hours of daylight are also essential parts of the celebration.
