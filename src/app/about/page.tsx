                We're two immigrants in Finland—one who passed the YKI test ✅,
                and one just starting their Finnish journey. Even after years of
                study, speaking Finnish in daily life is still a huge challenge.
                And when YLE shut down Kielokoulu, we felt the gap firsthand.
              </p>

              <p>
                That's why we're building Kielo 🚀: an AI-first, mobile-first
                language learning platform designed for people like us. We
                believe learning a language should be immersive, practical, and
                rooted in real life—not stuck in dusty textbooks.
              </p>

              <p>
                With AI + human creativity working together, we bring you fresh
                content every day, smart exercises, and authentic practice that
                fits into your busy life. Finnish is just the beginning—Swedish
                and more languages are next.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our mission? To make language learning not only effective, but
                exciting—so you can truly live the language ❤️.
